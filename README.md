# CC Stat Taker (Front End)

This project renders `main.jsx` as a standalone React front end using Vite.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the printed local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to use the app.

## Build
Bundle for production with `npm run build`, then preview with `npm run preview`.

Tailwind classes are resolved through the CDN in `index.html`, so no extra CSS build step is required.
